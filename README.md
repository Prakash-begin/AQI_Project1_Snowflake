# AQI_Snowflake_Streamlit_dashboard

This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline using Snowflake and Streamlit. Data is fetched hourly via API using GitHub Actions, then staged, cleaned, and modeled in Snowflake. Transformed data is visualized through a Streamlit dashboard for end-user consumption. The solution runs fully on AWS storage space, ensuring scalability and automation.
